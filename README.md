# Game-Show-App

##summery<br/>
This game show app uses javascript so change the DOM in multiple ways.I use a random word picked from an array to start the game.<br/>
Then I use a loop to find out if the letter picked by the player mches with a letter in the random word that was picked from the start of the game.<br/>
When the game is over I use js to change the css and show a win or lose screen.
